          The 9/11 operations are the greatest operation in the history of mankind. Nineteen mujahidin succeeded in inflicting human and <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a4/BernardMadoff.jpg" target="_blank">financial losses</a> against the enemy in a way that was unprecedented. Ten years on we look into some of the direct and indirect consequences of this glorious event.

            The operations of 9/11 came as a result of decades of American aggression. They follow half a century of American support for the state of Israel. Without this American support, the Israeli occupation of the Holy Land would have been impossible. America had <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gulf_War" target="_blank">attacked Iraq</a> and subjected it to an embargo that led to the deaths of at least a million and half Iraqis. America desecrated the Arabian Peninsula, the land of Muhammad and the two Holy Mosques, with its soldiers. It supported the authoritarian regimes that it is now disavowing after they passed their expiry dates and where supporting them was becoming an untenable position: <span>This was the backdrop of the operations of 9/11.</span> 
            <br>
            <br>
            Millions of Muslims around the world celebrated 9/11. It was a healing for the hearts of many who suffered because of America’s greed. In Palestine, Yemen, Indonesia, Pakistan, and elsewhere Muslims took to the streets to celebrate this heroic operation. 
            <br>
            <br>
            Ten years on, what have the operations achieved? What are the consequences of 9/11 on America and the world at large?

            Around three thousand Americans have lost their lives in the Twin Towers, the Pentagon, and Pennsylvania. Nineteen gallant mujahidin who gave up their lives for Allah brought about this death toll. Never in history has such a small number of fighters brought about such damage to an enemy. The targets themselves have also been exceptional: the symbols of American economic power and the Pentagon, both institutions that were, and still are, leading the war on Islam and Muslims. Three thousand were killed not because of the operation of 9/11 but because of American arrogance, it went throwing its weight around the Muslim world, starting two wars which added another few thousand to the death toll. We are not listing the American narration of the number of deaths in Iraq and Afghanistan because according to our sources, there is a definite underestimate of the real numbers. Our mujahidin brothers in Iraq for example, would tell us that they would engage the U.S. army and confirm the deaths of U.S. soldiers and yet, there would be an announcement by the U.S. army that would completely distort the facts.

            <br>
            Between four to six trillion dollars have been wasted on both wars according to Professor Linda Bilmes from the Harvand Kennedy School. That is between 30 to 40% of the U.S. deficit. So the wars of Afghanistan and Iraq have both been fought by borrowing money. This means that the damage isn’t over as it would be with a war that was already paid for; rather, it would carry on as long as America is still in debt. It is a likely scenario that the U.S. has got itself so deep in trouble because of the war on al Qaeda that it would bring its demise, first economically and then militarily. If that is the case, the wars of Afghanistan and Iraq would have been the single most important factors in the downfall of the United States of America.

            We have been preaching that the West is propping up values such as equality, freedom and human rights as a façade to cover its real face of imperialism and greed, but 9/11 did what was impossible for our words to do. It showed the world the reality and exposed the West for what it really is. Abu Ghraib, Guantanamo Bay and secret extraordinary renditions showed the world the American understanding of human rights. The Patriot Act and the treatment of Muslims in America and the West showed the world the reality of Western proclamation of equality. The limits placed on the rights of Muslims to express their beliefs revealed that in the West <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=homogeneity+stock+photo&espv=2&biw=1138&bih=676&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiw6oLLrL3SAhXslVQKHdZRAi8Q_AUIBigB" target="_blank">you are only free if you are not a Muslim.</a>

            <br>
            It is my belief that this achievement of 9/11 constitutes one of the greatest victories of 9/11. <span>This is because it would have been difficult to pursue the battle with the West when it was hiding its true face from the masses of the Muslims.</span> Even though many forms of aggression were committed before 9/11, but what happened post-9/11 brought the case to a different level. “Basically Bin Ladin said jump,” said Michael Scheuer in an episode of al-Jazeera’s 9/11 Decade series entitled The Image War. Mr. Bush and Mr. Cheney said, <span>“how high?”</span>

          Shaykh Usama gave his famous oath that America and her allies shouldn’t dream of enjoying security when the Muslims don’t. The added security in America and the West, the incurred costs, the inconveniences and forced changes it brought to the lives of Americans is another victory of 9/11. Americans are now forced to go through strict security measures in airports and billions of dollars are being spent on counter-terrorism in America and Europe. The operations of Omar al-Farouk and the parcel bombs played an important role in bringing such measures but it was 9/11 that set the ball in motion. To see the old American woman narrate her suffering at the hands of security officials and the mother at what she saw as a molestation of her child by the new enhanced pat down measures is to see the fulfillment of Shaykh Usama’s oath.

        Before 9/11, there was a myth, called the Western intelligence services. People held the CIA, the FBI and the MI5 to be omnipotent. Hollywood played a role in that with all of its <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QCJddx_lVXM" target="_blank">Bonds and Mission Impossibles</a>. The myth was so strong that so many conspiracy theories surrounded them and any significant event or plot on the world stage would be attributed to them. 9/11 shattered that myth forever. It not only exposed the intelligence services for not being omnipotent but it exposed them for being impotent. Such a huge special operation was hatched right under the noses of the intelligence services and yet they failed to get a sniff of it. The spooks were taken by surprise. “We didn’t see this one coming,” said Art Cummings, former Head of U.S. National Security. “We didn’t have good intelligence of what was going to happen.” 
        <br>
        Ten years from 9/11 and the mujahidin have spread out from Afghanistan to Pakistan, Yemen, Somalia, North Africa and God willing the list will grow and the proliferation of jihad will continue.
        <br>
        For us it’s just a matter of time. The question is not whether America will fall or not. <a href="https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ion=1&espv=2&ie=UTF-8#q=alphabet+market+value&*" target="_blank">America is already falling; it just
                hasn’t hit the ground yet.</a>
