              It turned out as we discovered later that a lot of the sourcing that had been attested to by the intelligence community (on WMD’s in Iraq) was wrong. Imagine how I felt the day that they finally came in and said to me well you know we don’t have four independent sources for that biological warfare van; it’s one guy and he’s loopy and he’s in a German jail and we’ve never talked to him. [...] And six months later the intelligence community is still standing behind their original judgments even though nothing has been found.

              If you couldn’t come to Afghanistan or Pakistan or Yemen or some country where al Qaeda had a training base, you didn’t have to. You could just read one of <a href="http://kaleidoscope.media/" target="_blank">al Qaeda’s online magazines</a> and acquire perhaps not to the same degree of professionalism or sophistication that you would have received in a terrorist training camp, but nonetheless still acquire the modicum of the fundamental skills needed to be a terrorist.

              Bin Ladin really messed us up. We both wasted the first decade of the 21st century. So the hole is deeper and yet political power is more defuse so no one can aggregate enough political power to make the right moves, to take the right steps to generate what we need to get out of this (financial) hole.

              Our political leaders are still fighting an enemy that doesn’t exist. They think, in a rather racist way, that the Muslim world is mad at Americans because we have freedom, and liberty and women in the workplace; and not because we are the unflinching supporters of Israel, because we support the Saudi police state,  because we have troops in the Arab Peninsula, in Iraq and other places. So really no matter how big the intelligence community gets in the United States, as long as U.S. foreign policy remains what it is, the enemy will continue to grow in numbers and probably lethality.

              I think we have to acknowledge that President Obama has <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rXPrfnU3G0" target="_blank">very little moral authority at this point</a>, because we know anybody who tries to rationalize the killing of innocent people, a criminal - George Zimmerman is a criminal - but President Obama is a global George Zimmerman (pointing to Obama’s attempt to rationalize the killing of innocent children in U.S. drone strikes).
