        An Interview

    </div><p>This hypothetical interview with the White House gangster was carried out by a member of our team. It is important to note that all of Obama’s answers are directly quoted from the counterterrorism speech he gave on May 23, 2013.

      <br>
      The main idea here is to focus on the change of the American tone regarding the zio-crusade war waged on the Muslim Ummah and its Jihadi front. This change comes after years of fighting and massive losses on the enemy’s side to the extent that the American regime has realized it’s too difficult to achieve victory in such a long ferocious war.

      <span class="bold">To begin, do you believe your regime plays clean and fair in this war?</span><br><br>

      I believe we compromised our basic values by using torture to interrogate our enemies, and detaining individuals in a way that run counter to the rule of law.<br><br>

      <span class="bold">Don&rsquo;t you care about the Muslim civilians that American drones kill?<br><br></span>

      It is a hard fact that U.S. strikes have resulted in civilian casualties, a risk that exists in all wars. For the families of those civilians, no words or legal construct can justify their loss. For me, and those in my chain of command, these deaths will haunt us as long as we live, just as we are haunted by the civilian casualties that have occurred through conventional fighting in Afgh&#257;nist&#257;n and Ir&#257;q.<br><br>

      <span class="bold">How do you assess the effect on the U.S. caused by the zio-crusade war you lead against Islam?<br><br></span>

      For over the last decade, our nation has spent well over a trillion dollars on war, exploding our deficits and constraining our ability to nation build here at home. Our service-members and their families have sacrificed far more on our behalf. Nearly 7,000 Americans have made the ultimate sacrifice. Many more have left a part of themselves on the battlefield, or brought the shadows of battle back home.<br><br>

      <span class="bold">Al-Q&#257;eda says that you are too coward to put boots on Muslim grounds; you cannot take a new defeat after what happened to your army in Ir&#257;q and Afgh&#257;nist&#257;n. How true is this claim?<br><br></span>

      It is false to assert that putting boots on the ground is less likely to result in civilian deaths, or to create enemies in the Muslim world. The result would be more U.S. deaths, more Blackhawks down, more confrontations with local populations, and an inevitable mission creep in support of such raids that could easily escalate into new wars. So yes, the conflict with Al-Q&#257;eda, like all armed conflicts, invites tragedy.<br><br>

      <span class="bold">Are you planning to utilize your &lsquo;well trained&rsquo; Special Forces? Is there any worry that they may let your regime down like they did in the failed raid in Barawe, Somalia?<br><br></span>

      It is also not possible for America to simply deploy a team of Special Forces to capture every terrorist. And even when such an approach may be possible, there are places where it would pose profound risks to our troops and local civilians where a terrorist compound cannot be breached without triggering a firefight with surrounding tribal communities that pose no threat to us, or when putting U.S. boots on the ground may trigger a major international crisis.<br><br>

      <span class="bold">Why do you always avoid giving a clear pledge to defeat what you call &lsquo;terror&rsquo;?<br><br></span>

      Neither I, nor any president, can promise the total defeat of terror.<br><br>

      <span class="bold">Do you believe your vicious war against Islam and Muslims will end someday?<br><br></span>

      This war, like all wars, must end. That&rsquo;s what history advises. That is what our democracy demands.<br><br>

      <span class="bold">After over a decade of launching an expensive war and billions of dollars you have spent on beefing up security measures, does America still fear Jihadi attacks on its soil?<br><br></span>

      Our nation is still threatened by terrorists. From Benghazi to Boston, we have been tragically reminded of that truth<br><br>

      <span class="bold">Finally, how much damage can a lone Mujahid do to harm America? Make your answer short. Your time is up.<br><br></span>

      U.S. citizens or legal residents can do enormous damage, particularly when inspired by larger notions of violent Jihad. That pull towards extremism appears to have led to the shooting at Fort Hood, and the bombing of the Boston Marathon.
