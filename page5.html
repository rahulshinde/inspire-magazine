          <span class="bold uppercase">not so long ago,</span> in the mysterious land of survival of the fittest, there lived an ugly wolf hybrid known as Wolfdog. Among his peers, he was distinguished by his big head, a long tongue and a loud howl. Hence, he became the alpha male in his pack.
          <br /><br />          One day, as Wolfdog was on a hilltop searching for a refill for his rumbling stomach, he saw a young lamb with fluffy wool playing in a grassy glade. Wolfdog climbed down the hill to &lsquo;meet&rsquo; the charming little lamb, resolved not to lay violent hands on him, but to find some plea to justify to the Lamb his right to eat him. He thus addressed him:<br /><br />
          &ldquo;<span class="red">Kid, last year you grossly insulted me.</span>&rdquo;<br /><br />
          &ldquo;<span class="red">Indeed,</span>&rdquo;bleated the Lamb in a mournful tone of voice, &ldquo;<span class="red">I was not then born.</span>&rdquo; Then said Wolfdog,<br /><br />
          &ldquo;<span class="red">You feed in my pasture.</span>&rdquo;<br /><br />          
          &ldquo;<span class="red">No, good sir,</span>&rdquo; replied the Lamb, &ldquo;<span class="red">I have not yet tasted grass.</span>&rdquo; Again said the Wolf,<br /><br />          
          &ldquo;<span class="red">You drink of my well.</span>&rdquo;<br /><br />          
          &ldquo;<span class="red">No!</span>&rdquo; exclaimed the Lamb, &ldquo;<span class="red">I never yet drank water, for as yet my mother&rsquo;s milk is both food and drink to me.</span>&rdquo;<br /><br />          
          &ldquo;<span class="red">Well! I won&rsquo;t remain supperless,</span>&rdquo;thought he. He seized him and ate him up, saying, &ldquo;<span class="red">so it must have been your mother!</span>&rdquo;<br>

          The Mother powerlessly followed the dialogue. What could this poor mother do when she saw her beloved son being torn into pieces between the teeth of the wolf? She knew she could not reclaim her right, but in the passion of motherhood, this good mother butted Wolfdog. Of course the wolf was not affected at all, but he became very furious;his pupils dilated. He raised the base of his tail. How dare this ewe touch me, thought he.<br /><br />

          He howled with a long, smooth sound, &ldquo;<span class="red">This is a terrorist! This is a terrorist!</span>&rdquo; All other wolves howled, repeating Wolfdog&rsquo;s words, creating an illusion that there were many condemning the act of the ewe. It is not strange that these howls were heard from ten miles away, but the strange thing is how these howls echoed throughout the forest. Whereby the parrots joined in and repeated what Wolfdog said, saying,<br /><br />

          &ldquo;<span class="red">We condemn the ewe&rsquo;s butt against the wolf, all the animals are against this barbaric act!</span>&rdquo;
