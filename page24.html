          <h2>abstract</h2>
          <p>Assassination is the killing of a prominent individual(s); be it in a military, security, political, economic or any other prominent establishment. A tactic was used by past and even modern warfare. Assassinations are categorized as intelligence operations. They are either performed by a group (as in Charlie Hebdo) or by organizations (as in governments, Jihadi group etc.). In the case of organizations, assassinations may take on a much bigger scale, an ambush or raid. Assassinations by organizations can also be executed by a single person, who is adequately trained to execute the operation in its appropriate phases and in a suitable approach.
          <br><br>
          As for us at Inspire Magazine, we will concentrate on explaining assassination operations with regards to an individual—so as to be in line with Lone Jihad. Assassination operations can be categorized as military or intelligence. But in most cases they fall into intelligence operations—this is because what is desired is to achieve great results with little cost. And this is what America has been using after attaining great economic losses in large-scale military operations, losing its worldwide military supremacy. Most of its assassination operations are by unmanned drones, exposing its weakness and inability to capture and ‘bring to justice’, as they claim. During the past, they executed a large military campaign (Afghanistan) by occupying large swathe of lands, losing millions of dollars in order to assassinate a single person. And this strategy failed miserably.
          <br><br>
          The disbelievers and Mushrikin had tried to assassinate the prophet (ﷺ) in many different ways. They chose to assassinate him by an individual approach. This occurred when a female Jew poisoned the prophet’s food. Another case is when Umayr bin wahhab wanted to kill the prophet (ﷺ) inside his mosque. They also resorted to assassinate him using a group. An example is when a group of Jews wanted to throw a huge stone at the prophet while he was sitting, but Allah saved him. And when the Quraish wanted to kill him by sending a group of fighters to his home. The Quraysh made many attempts to try to kill the Prophet (ﷺ) using large-scale military operations, as was seen in many battles. By the grace of Allah all of these attempts were futile. Assassination operations, if studied and executed in a well organized program, will achieve great goals with the least of costs.
          <br><br>
          Organized from the initial phase of selecting a target to actual assassination. Using the appropriate means, steps, phases and techniques. That is why we have dedicated this issue and in later issues a complete comprehensive assassination program appropriate for a Lone Mujahid. We encourage you to read and understand the following in order to achieve your goals as desired. Among the necessary things for a Lone Mujahid to learn concerning this topic is, the stages and phases of an assassination operation; the series of steps, from inception to execution.

            The first step in an assassination operation is to identify your target. The size of operation mainly depends on the type of target and a measure of success in attaining our objectives in this war with the west. Some targets, if were to be assassinated, will bring us closer to victory. This is because the west is based upon intellect and individual personalities not on thought or opinion. On the other hand Muslims follow a guided path that does not end with the death of a personality or individual. And because of that, concentrating our operations on important personalities will directly affect the outcome of this war. And this is exactly what we are calling for. This war is surrounded and supported by America’s Intelligentsia. And our war with America will be prioritized by targeting its economy; and we will select targets by prioritizing economic personalities. Selecting a target for assassination, is divided into two categories; assassinating a target in order to achieve either strategic or tactical goals. As for us, we will be concentrating on operations that will yield strategic goals, directly affecting our war. As for tactical targets, such as assassinating military or security personnel inside America, its resulting effects do not surface unless after executing many operations of the like. And this cannot be realized except with the existence of a Jihadi organization inside America. And it requires a long period of time to execute these operations and requires other independent elements e.g. the masses and population to back you up in order to achieve success. That is why it is necessary for us to concentrate on targeting prominent personalities in order to achieve great goals in a short period. And we will specifically talk about the details of targeting prominent personalities in the article, “Assassinations - Field Tactic”.

          <h2>B. Collecting Information</h2>
          <img src="img/page24/charliemag.jpg"></img>
        </div>
        <div class="rcolumn">
          <p>
            This is the most important stage in your operation. Your choice of strategy will be selected based on the information at hand. The acquired information will direct you to the best and effective technique and path for your operation. Two major questions arise, of which all other questions fall into:
            <br><br>
            <span class="bold">1. Where can the target be found?</span>
            This question can be asked in great details: Where does the target reside? Where does he work? Where does he visit for recreational activities? Where does he shop?
            <br><br>
            <span class="bold">2. Another major question is when?</span>
            The answer to this question specifically describes the actual time he is present in the previously mentioned locations. And the answer to the ‘when’ question should be according to the year, month, day, hour and minute.
            <br><br>
            In the process of collecting information, one will get a detailed understanding of the target’s movements. Thereupon, being able to complete other remaining steps of the operation. You should bear in mind that every target has a security loophole, however much the security precaution he takes. We  can  categorize  the  source  and  the  means  of
            collecting information into:
            <br><br>
            <span class="bold">A. i. General means of communication.</span>
            Like televisions, newspaper, magazines and internet - especially the social media where one can very much benefit from.
            <br><br>
            <span class="bold">B. Specific means of communication.</span>
            Having access to the target’s friend, close person or a neighbor. Or benefiting by collecting information on any person who has direct or indirect contact with the target.
            <br><br>
            <span class="bold">C. Collecting information from close.</span>
            Collecting information from close includes observing the targeted building or any building related to the target. During this process, critical information will be acquired in much detail. Another way is to acquire information from a mobile target so as to specifically know the movements of the target. This should be done carefully and from a distance so as not to alert the target. He should blend-in with the environment or camouflage himself during the process. Another method is by visiting: Personally visiting the location where you collected the information to personally verify the data collected. And having a detailed picture of the information collected.

            <span id="blockquote">A plan is generated basing on the information at hand and the capabilities available: then comes the question of how? How can we generate a desired, simple plan to attain the best of results and be efficient? The answer to this main question is obtained by answering the following:</span>
            <br><br>

            1.	What is the weak point of the target that can be exploited to penetrate the target?<br>
            2.	When is the target in least protection?<br>
            3.	Which is the best technique available to execute the operation?<br>
            4.	How has the executor prepared for the operation? Is it a Martydom operation, inghimaasi (Immersing onself deep into enemy lines) or an assault?<br>
            5.	When the executor of the operation performs an assault, then he must have a retreat plan. He will have to answer two questions:<br>
            » What is the technique to be used in order to retreat safely?<br>
            » How will you cover-up your traces and yourself after an operation?

        <div class="rcolumn">
          <p>
            <span class="bold">1. Acquire (e.g. Buying) or prepare (e.g. Homemade bomb) your weapon:</span>
            <br><br>
            After identifying the weapon to use, begins the stage of searching for it. This is a difficult stage for those living in the West, especially when the type of operation requires a specific type of weapon. We at Inspire Magazine do our best to ease the process of acquiring or preparing your choice of weapon. Weapons to be used in assassination operations can be categorized into four main categories, they are:
            <br><br>
            •	Cold Weapons e.g. Knife, axe
            •	Firearms e.g. Pistol, automatic refile, sniper weapon
            •	Explosives e.g. Grenades, bomb, mines, car bomb
            •	Poisons
            <br><br>
            Selecting the appropriate type of weapon plays an important role in directing and planning your steps for the operation. It is important to know that an assassination operation may require the use of more than one type of weapon. Thus if your choice of weapon is a homemade explosive, then you should set aside ample time for designing it basing on your plan. While military explosives are not readily available as complete, thus assembling one might take time.
            <br><br>
            <span class="bold">2. Training with your weapon of choice:</span>
            <br><br>
            You must be well trained to use your choice of weapon for the assassination operation. For example, cold weapons training; hand-to-hand combat, in a local gym. Or firearms training in a gun club. As for explosives, we at Inspire have previously placed intermediate lessons concerning this subject - so one may benefit from. Before using explosives, it is better to experiment with small amounts before the final execution.
            <br><br>
            <span class="bold">3. Psychological and spiritual preparation.</span>
            <br><br>
            It is important to psychologically and spiritually prepare yourself before executing the operation. Rather this is required in all stages of preparing your operation. We emphasized it at this stage because most of the preparations have been done and set, and one has enough time to isolate himself for worship. Allah says { So when you have finished [your duties], then stand up [for worship].. } (94:7) So it is important for the brother to increase in worship and remembrance to what Allah has promised for the Martyr in His path. Contemplating on the great role he is playing for the Ummah. And remembering that he is a building block in the revival of the Khilafa, returning its glory and strengthening the religion.

        <div class="rcolumn">
          <p>Important points to note when executing the operation are:
            <br><br>
            Use your cover and camouflage to hide your identity to get as close as you can to the target, hit the target at the desired area. Your cover will help you answer the surprise question, “Why are you here?
            <br><br>
            It is important to verify your hit on the target, by hiting the target on the head and heart.
            <br><br>
            Be steadfast and increase the remembrance of Allah Don’t hesitate in order to conduct your operation in the best of manner. Allah says {O you who believe! whenyou meet (an enemy) force, take a firm stand agains them and remember the name of Allah much, so that you might be successful } [8:4]
            <br><br>
            Finally: retreat from the area of operation without leaving any traces. Stay out of sight. And use a means of transportation that will remove you from the area without attracting any attention.
            <br><br>
            Get out of the scope of danger!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

            Assassination operations are categorized based on the target location; Assassination on a residential building, on the street and so on. In this particular Issue, we will be discussing assassination at a workplace. What differentiates this category from the rest is that in mostl cases, a workplace-compound is usually protected and guarded by security, though this may vary from building to building.
            One should always be cautious and know the number of guards, types of weapons and the security perimeter surrounding building.
            <br><br>
            Methods of infiltrating a building’s outer security include:
            <br><br>
            I. Silent Infiltration Infiltration is by stealth and deception.t
            Weapons can be concealed in many different ways, such that one can by pass security forces without alerting them. Entering the building in a desired cover-up, thus hiding his identity. He may enter a building as an employee or a cleaner or a cook, customer or a visitor. Specific personalities are suitable for particular situation. You should identify and select an identity basing on the collected information.
            <br><br>
            After penetrating security, one might arrive at the target and use one of the following types of weapons:
<br><br>
            Cold weapons: Specifically a knife. After training well in
            knife combat the target can be attacked either silently or
            in a much open manner. Attacking the target in the
            heart or head.
<br><br>
            Firearms : Specifically a pistol. Using a silencer will determine if the assassination is a silent or open assassination. iii. Explosives: There are many ways to use explosives on the target. A martyrdom operation brother might use the hidden bomb (refer to Issue 13). Or one may use a hidden parcel bomb to send it to the target in different forms or by placing the explosives on the target’s office desk. Exploding it from afar using a timer. II. Assault and forceful infiltration This was seen in the operation of the Koachi brothers. They forcefully eliminated the outer security then entered the fortified building in a quick rapid manner. Immediately arriving at the target and the targeted room with precision. And here we would like to explain the operation with regards to Lone Jihad. Generally attacking a building in such a manner will require two major weapons: A Firearm and a hand grenade Assassination operations are categorized based on the target location—assassination on a residential building, on the street and so on.

<br><br>
            This was seen in the operation of the Koachi brothers. They forcefully eliminated the outer security then entered the fortified building in a quick rapid manner. Immediately arriving at the target and the targeted room with precision.
<br><br>
             And here we would like to explain the operation with regards to Lone Jihad. Generally attacking a building in such a manner will require two major weapons: A Firearm and
            a hand grenade.
<br><br>
            Firearms: It is recommended to use an automatic weapon, such as a Kalshinkov, M16 or any other assault weapon. This is because such weapons allow you to
            fire many rounds, which terrifies and quickly eliminates the enemy. This type of weapon is used when using
            an open assault. Such assault might alert those inside
            the building by the first shot. As such one should be quick in his operation and instill fear in the enemy, confuse and disorient the enemy during the time of storming the building. In this method, a pistol might be used together with a grende, so as to achieve the same effect as
            an automatic weapon - instilling fear and rapid clearance of the enemy.
<br><br>
            Hand Grenades: These play an important role in an assault operation on a building or during retreat. During the assault, hand grenades are used to clear rooms in a quick and safe way for the attacker to maneuver. They may be used to counter any fire coming from the side of the enemy. Grenades by themselves play an important role: The blast by itself disorients and terrorizes the enemy. They play a vital role during retreat. The attacker may throw hand grenades in the directions where the enemy is firing from, allowing for safe retreat and away from the fire zone. And because of the importance of hand grenades in such operations, and the difficulty of acquiring them in the West. We, at Inspire Magazine, have presented to you, in a simplified manner, a how- to guide in making your own hand grenades.
