        The West Should Ban the Niqab Covering its Real Face

        <p>The Islāmic ruling on the obligation of the niqāb is disputed among the scholars of Islām. However, even those who do not mandate it do state that it is a recommended and virtuous act. In other words, to wear the niqāb is a Muslim woman’s “right”.
        <br>
        <br>
        Over this “right”, various legislative wars are being fought out throughout Western parliaments and courts. The war on Islām is taking different faces. There is a physical war being fought out in Afghanistan, Iraq, and now an escalating remote control war on Pakistan, Yemen and Somalia. There is a battle of hearts and minds fought out in the media and in academia, and then there is a legislative war being fought out in parliaments and courtrooms across Europe and North America, and the focus of this battle is the niqāb.

        It is interesting how this item of clothing a Muslim woman may choose to wear would turn out to be the symbol, and point of contention, in an undergoing ideological battle between Islām and the West. <span>The niqāb is today’s manifestation of a clash of civilizations and an additional proof to a mounting body of evidence that the West is anything but tolerant towards its Muslim population.</span>
        <br>
        <br>
        In the words of the French President, Nicolas Sarkozy, we can see an illustration of a Western view of the niqāb: “The problem of
        </p>
        <br>
        <div class="blockquote">
          “Wear the niqāb as a public sign of their rejection of forced assimilation... as a public statement that is carried as a badge of honor in face of a decadent Western way of life...”
        </div>
        <p>the burqais not a religious problem. It is a problem concerning the freedom of women, the dignity of women. The burqa is not a reli gious symbol but a sign of subservience, of abasement. I want to say solemnly that it is not welcome on the territory of the French Republic. We cannot accept in our country women who are prisoners behind a grill, cut off from all social life, deprived of any identity. This is not the French Republic’s idea about the dignity of women.”
        <br>
        <br>
        This is quite a lot to pile up on top of this garment: The niqāb is a problem to the dignity of women, it is a symbol of subservience and abasement, it imprisons a woman and cuts her off and deprives her of her identity!
        <br>
        <br>
        This is what the head of the French Republic had to say about the garment millions of Muslim women around the world wear and have been wearing for centuries. Let us also not forget that nothing used to be seen from the wives of the Messenger of Allāh; not even their eyes and according to Sarkozy, that is an abasement that deprives women of their identity.</p>

          The mujāhidīn, who are the true and honest representatives and spokesmen for Islām today, are straightforward in their opposition to Western imperialism and Western values that are being imposed on the Muslim world by force. But the West is hiding behind a niqāb of human rights, civil liberties, women’s rights, gender equality and other rallying slogans while in practice it is being imperialistic, intolerant, chauvinistic and discriminating against the Muslim population of Western countries.
          <br>
          <br>
          As mentioned above the niqāb is not mandatory on Muslim women according to many scholars. But because it is a right of Muslim women and <span>because it has become a symbol of being a Muslim today, Muslims need to take a firm position in this battle and dig in their trenches.</span>
          <br>
          <br>
          For this reason we promote that Muslim women in the West who do not view wearing niqāb as being a religious duty to wear the niqāb as a public <span>sign of their rejection of forced assimilation</span>, as a symbol of their pride at being Muslim, as a public statement that is carried as a badge of honor in face of a decadent Western way of life, and a statement that proclaims that even if I am not obliged to wear the niqāb, I will wear it because I refuse to have the West decide for me how I am going to practice my religion.
          <br>
          <br>
          <span>Muslim women wear the niqāb because they want to wear it and because they choose to.</span> Our sisters need to dispel the Western myth that Muslim women need to be emancipated because they are being forced into wearing a garment they do not want to wear.

        <p>
          The ruling of the niqāb is irrelevant here. It would not have made much, if any, difference in the Western perception of the niqāb if the four Imāmsagreed on the obligation of niqāb or if Imām Ahmad or Ibn Taymīyyah didn’t. The niqāb is carrying the weight it is carrying because it is a publicly visible sign of being a Muslim. Similar to the minarets it is a symbol of Islām. Whether the niqāb is an obligation or not, and the fact that the minarets are not actually rooted in Islāmic tradition are not important to the issue here because it is not the niqāb or the minaret that the West is against, it is Islām itself, and these are merely symbols for it.
          <br>
          <br>
          One may argue that the ruling is relevant and that the West is not against Islām because it is the niqāb that is under attack and not the veil. They may argue that the niqāb is under attack because it is a security risk and because many “experts” tell us that the niqāb is an Arabian rather than Islāmic costume and we are not against the veil which Muslims say is a religious practice that women must abide by. That is what some may argue. The answer to that is two-fold. First, as we have been witnessing, there is a gradual attack that is starting from bottom up. It is a step-by-step process that is meant to assimilate the Muslims gradually rather than overwhelm them at risk of alienating them. Second, the veil has in fact already suffered its own attacks. There are already cases where Muslim women who already have their faces uncovered are asked to take the next step of uncovering their head. This has happened in the US state of Georgia and in France and we should expect more.
          <br>
          The evidence for the claim that it is Islām rather than the niqāb or the minaret that is under attack, is the torrent of cartoons defaming Muhammad under the pretext of the freedom of expression. Muslims are accused of being oversensitive and not getting the “joke”. This claim is a joke in itself and it is the West that is not getting it. If the West has chosen not to take religion seriously because its religion has a history of intolerance and bloodshed, and is dogmatically inconsistent then that is the West’s prerogative on whether to take their religions seriously or not. But why should that apply to Islām?

        <div class="blockquote">
          “Islām is not a manmade religion; it is not a religion that has been tampered with as the rabbis and priests did with the other two Abrahamic faiths.”

        <p>
          If the Jews came to the conclusion that the Old Testament has simply too many injunctions for executing people to be taken seriously in today’s world and the Christians had enough of the Pope’s inquisition then they should actually be commended for distancing the Church from the State. But all of that has nothing to do with Islām because Islām is not a manmade religion; it is not a religion that has been tampered with as the rabbis and priests did with the other two Abrahamic faiths. The Qur’ān is original and Muslims are the only people on the face of the earth who possess a detailed and authentic history and record of statements made by any Prophet since Ādam all the way to Muhammad. Muslims know what the seal of the Prophets did and said, peace be upon him. The same cannot be said about the histories of either Moses or Jesus.
          <br>
          <br>
          Therefore, we as Muslims do take Islām seriously and we take it literally. We also take the honor of Muhammad seriously and we love him dearly. Cartoons defaming Muhammad are no joke and Muslims have made that very clear, yet the defamation continues as we have recently seen with the South Park affair.
          <br>
          <br>
          With the wars of niqāb being fought out and the defamation of Muhammad continuing, and a physical battle being fought out in various parts of the Muslim world, one should only expect the West to remain a field of operation for the mujāhidīn. Within a short span of time there was Fort Hood, the operation of `Umar al-Fārūq, the attempt against the Swedish cartoonist and finally Times Square. There is no reason to believe that such attacks would abate.
