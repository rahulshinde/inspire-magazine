          <p>These perpetrators are not operating in a vacuum. Instead they are operating within a system that is offering them support and protection. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Security_Entry-Exit_Registration_System" target="_blank">government</a>, <a href="http://www.nbcnews.com/storyline/orlando-nightclub-massacre/donald-trump-pushes-gop-toward-far-right-islam-speech-n591561" target="_blank">political parties</a>, <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/onpolitics/2016/03/23/ted-cruz-muslim-patrols-donald-trump/82156258/" target="_blank">the police</a>, <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/the-n-s-a-s-spying-on-muslim-americans" target="_blank">the intelligence services</a>, blogs, <a href="http://cramer.pleintekst.nl/essays/crapularity_hermeneutics/" target="blanks">social networks</a>, the media, and the list goes on, are part of a system within which the defamation of Islam is not only protected but promoted. The main elements in this system are the laws that make this blasphemy legal. Because they are practicing a “right” that is defended by the law, they have the backing of the entire Western political system. This would make the attacking of any Western target legal from an Islamic viewpoint. The entire Western system is staunchly protecting and promoting this defamation of Muhammad and therefore it is the entire western system that is at war with Islam. Assassinations, bombings, and acts of arson are all legiti - mate forms of revenge against a system that relishes the sacrilege of Islam in the name of freedom.</p>

          <img src="img/page13/ya.jpg"></img>
          <p>To fellow Muslims I say, even if you are among those who have lagged behind the caravan and haven’t gone to battle against the enemies of Islam, you should still expect the battle to eventually come to you, whether you like it or not. While our enemies are evil and depraved, they aren’t stupid, and when choosing the targets of their aggression, they usually start with the <a href="https://youtu.be/E-ddL5jbgig?t=49" target="_blank">weakest links</a> in the chain, which are the peaceful and pacifistic types. An attitude of complacency and nonresistance in the face of clear and present wrongs, threats and dangers serves no one but the enemy, and that’s why everyone of us must be prepared to fight today rather than tomorrow. So hurry up and join the caravan. As for my brothers the Mujahideen, those already discharging the duty of defending Islam and its followers, I say to them: let us examine ourselves on a regular basis to make sure our intentions are sound and our actions are correct; let us make sure that we are fighting for the sake of Allah, not for the sake of amameer, group, temporal power or worldly gain, because these things are temporary and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BS90PApRE84" target="_blank">will soon pass</a>: only Allah is permanent and will remain. Let us understand our place within the Ummah and our duties and responsibilities towards it; let us show mercy and kindness towards the weak and helpless; let us display tolerance for our fellow Muslims and Mujahideen whatever our differences with them and however much we feel they have let us down.</p>

          <p>The immediate battle which we have to prevail, is the battle with our own selves, the battle with our weaknesses and our clinging to this earth. It is the struggle with our hesitation, fear, personal issues, holding to power,  fame, family, wealth and children. We should struggle not to prefer the minute benefits of this earth, while leaving behind sacrificing for the sake of Allah. If we have yaqin that Allah is the Creator and the only Provider, and that everything is in His command, then you should know that our holding firm to this earth and wealth will not increase anything in our age, our sustenance or the sustenance of our family. Then I see <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bOtjHJqTTNQ" target="_blank">no reason for being stingy</a> with your wealth or be a coward to go forth in Jihad.</p>

They should not sit behind but rather go after them, fight them and follow their traces: Until there remains no power, and until there is no fitnah and the religion is solely for the sake of Allah.</p>

          <p>My Muslim Ummah, the head of this international infidelity is trying very hard not to directly confront the Mujahideen, and this is unexceptable. One of the greatest blessings of Allah on the Mujahideen led by my father, may Allah have mercy on him, was putting a strategic plan to lure the head of the global infidel. Allah the Great and Exalted blessed him with it and its success. He was able to concentrate on America, and to exhaust it as much as possible, to the point that it lost its prestige and position, and lost its soldiers, and dissipated its economy for a costly war, thus making its stay in our country more expensive than robbing our wealth, and forcing him to retreat and leave. Focusing on the head of international infidelity requires staying as far away as possible from its local agents and allies in an effort to provide the most direct blows, which will result in its fall and its abandoning its agents, where it will be easy to deal with after that, with permission from Allah. I figured that the Zionist-Crusader alliance led by America today is like a bird: <a href="https://vimeo.com/29589320" target="_blank">America is its head</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSRR_HizWVw" target="_blank">NATO is one wing and the Jewish state in the occupied Palestine is the other wing</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sleep_paralysis#/media/File:Fritz_Schwimbeck_-_My_Dream,_My_Bad_Dream._1915.jpg" target="_blank">and the legs are the oppressive dictators sitting on the chests of the peoples of the Muslim Ummah</a>. By concentrating on the head, with permission from Allah, it guarantees that all will vanish. This is the general plan of the Mujahideen. For what America and its allies fear the most is that we shift the battle from Kabul, Baghdad, and Gaza to Washington, London, Paris, and Tel Aviv, and that we transfer the battle to all of the interests of America, the Jews, and the West in the world. O youth of Islam, this is an obligation upon you, and this is your role, so show Allah from you what He will be satisfied with, may Allah grant you victory, support you, guide you, and be with you. Let there be a good example for you in the modern day knights and lions of the likes of Nidal Hassan, Muhammad Merrah, Umar Farooq, may Allah hasten his release, and the brothers <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=name+a+more+iconic+duo+i%27ll+wait&oq=name+a+more+iconic+duo+i%27ll+wait&aqs=chrome..69i57j69i64.2631j0j1&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8" target="_blank">Tamerlan and Jahar Tsarnaev</a>, My beloved brothers, know that you are from the dedicated soldiers of Allah. He has blessed you and honoured you with Jihad in His way, so if you do it, you shall vex the enemies of Allah in ways that cannot be done by many of your brothers here. A single sincere operation from one knight amongst you, who chose a target well, and performed it well, will shake the roots of the major countries greatly. So imagine the impact of tens of operations.</p>

            <p>As for our goal, it is to make the religion of Allah established on earth. Liberate Muslim lands, liberate Palestine. Remove people from being slaves of the tyrants, into worshipping Allah alone. And removing them from the confinements of this world; wealth, economy, politics and religious ignorance. Free people from democratic systems, capitalism, monopo - lism, opportunism and discrimination, into implementing the laws of Allah which also deals with matters pertaining to non-Muslims. As for our path, it is Da’awa and Jihad. Da’wah in a good approach to those who do not fight nor help in fighting Muslims, nor show any form of enmity towards Muslims. Allah Says { Allah does not for - bid you to deal justly and kindly with those who fought not against you on account of religion nor drove you out of your homes. Verily, Allah loves those who deal with equity. } [60:7] This is a common call sent to America and Europe by the leaders of Jihad., a call to (embrace) Islam. We encourage them to be against the oppression of their leaders., to use their power to change policies that are against Muslims. And it is evident enough that (the Western people) participate in this war by electing their governments, paying taxes that fund their governments in its aggression towards Muslims, and helping the Zionist oppressors in Palestine. Their silence or participation in crimes and aggression towards Muslims living in their countries; imprisonment, persecution, house arrests and the vicious immoral media campaign in defaming the prophet and the Sharia. As for our Jihad, then this is to whosoever seeks to bring corruption on earth, and aggression in Muslim lands or whosoever substitutes the laws of Allah with those of men, and does not disbelieve in taghut but rather accept them as lords besides Allah - ordering, making halal, making haram. And befriends the enemies of Allah and show enmity towards His awliyah. As for our weapon, then the help of Allah is with us. Followed by the unity of the Ummah under the truthful scholars and leaders. And the removal of any traces of jahiliyyah resulting from borders drawn by the crusaders. And indeed if the Ummah was to be the desire of every Muslim and his group (then they would have achieved alot). And we at Qa’datul Jihad see this as something feasible, tangible and doable.</p>
