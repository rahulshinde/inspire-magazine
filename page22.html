        <h3 id="firsthead">INSPIRE MAGAZINE’s goal is to empower Muslim <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=kid+playing+in+park+stock+photo&espv=2&biw=1138&bih=676&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwilkYXorr3SAhVE5GMKHU4YDJgQ_AUIBigB" target="_blank">youth</a>. And what is empowerment without being strong, powerful and intelligent? In this section, we give you strength, power and intelligence. Believe me, using car bombs gives you all that.</h3>
        <p>
          It is absolutely simple. And we will make it simpler for you biidhnill&amacr;h, so that every Muslim, who loves All&amacr;h and His Messenger, and wants to accelerate Islam’s victory, becomes prepare to make, even if this is the  rst military material his eyes has set on.

        <p>
          <p>This recipe gives you the ability to make a car bomb even in countries with tight security and surveillance. The reason<br>is: primary materials easily available and they do not raise suspicion. These materials are not explosives in nature. But after you have assemble and prepare them, they become a bomb ready for destruction, biidhnill&amacr;h.<br>This type of car bomb is not usually used to destroy buildings, but is very effective in killing <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Brief-History-Neoliberalism-David-Harvey/dp/0199283273" target="_blank">individuals</a><br>The merit of this method is that you can prepare a car bomb in a few hours during the availability of the primary materials. So there is less worry about your personal security.<br><br>
          <span class="arephemph">My Muslim brother, before you start reading the instructions, remember that this type of operation if prepared well and an appropiate target is chosen and Allah decrees success for you, history will never forget it. It will be recorded as a crushing defeat on the enemies of Islam.</span></p>

        <h2>THE GENERAL IDEA:</h2>

        <p>We are going to mix two gases; one an oxidizer, another a fuel, in one sealed container that will change the normal combustion of the two materials into an explosive combustion. The explosion will start as soon as a  ame emitted from a torch comes in contact with the gas that will burn rapidly under very high pressure.</p>

          <h3>Pressure Units</h3>
          <p>The standard atmosphere that we live in is a unit of pressure.<br><br>
            The standard atmosphere is almost equal to one bar (1 bar &#8776; 1 atm).<br><br>
            In this procedure we are going to use bar as the standard pressure unit for the gas cylinders.<br><br>
            When you come across any other unit in your barometer e.g. <a href="https://www.boundless.com/chemistry/textbooks/boundless-chemistry-textbook/gases-5/properties-of-gases-50/si-units-of-pressure-253-1861/" target="_blank">Pascals</a>, kiloPascals or psi, convert it into bar.<br><br>
            Conversion is very simple, all you have to do is use a converter in your computer OS calculator.<br><br>
            A cooking gas cylinder can sustain up to 12 bars.<br><br>
            An oxygen cylinder can sustain up to 135 bars.<br><br>
            &lsquo;kg/cm^2&rsquo; is the same as atm (atmosphere).</p>
        </div>

        <h2>OPERATIONAL IDEA:</h2>
        <div class="imagewrapper">
          <img src="img/insideamerica/oxygenboom.png"/>
        </div>
        <p>

          Pure &lsquo;oxygen&rsquo; was used as the oxidizing gas, cooking gas &lsquo;propane&rsquo; as the fuel, and cooking gas cylinder as the sealed container.<br><br>
          &bull; An amount of gas was discharged from the cooking gas cylinder.<br><br>
          &bull; The highly pressurized oxygen cylinder was connected to the cooking gas cylinder.<br><br>
          &bull; When the safety valves of both the cylinders were opened, oxygen gas moved into the cooking gas cylinder directly. This was caused by pressure difference.<br><br>
          &bull; The pressure inside the oxygen cylinder was very high compared to that inside the cooking gas cylinder<br>
          &bull; We know that gas moves from a high pressure region to a lower pressure region.

        </p>

        <h2>PRESSURE DIFFERENCE:</h2>
        <p>While the tap is closed, the pressure in the yellow balloon is zero, while the pressure in the red balloon is one. But when we open the tap, gas moves from the high pressure region (red balloon) to the low pressure region (yellow balloon) in such the pressures in the two balloons become equal.</p>

          <img src="img/insideamerica/pressure2.png"/>
        </div>
        <h2>BAROMETERS:</h2>
        <p>
          &bull; There are different types of barometers, some measure up to 11 bars, others up to 280 bars, and others in between. Barometers used to measure tire pressure usually measure up to 11, 12 or 16 bars. &bull; Barometers used for gas cylinders differ as per the type of the cylinder. For example, large oxygen cylinders use barometers of 240 bars or 280 bars. Medium cooking gas cylinders use barometers of 34 or 36 bars. There are also many other types of barometers. &bull; Barometers use different units, some use bars, others &lsquo;atm&rsquo;, pound per square inch (psi), Pascals (Pa) or milimeter of mercury (mmHg).

        <h2>
        HERE ARE SOME BAROMETERS:
        </h2>
        <p>
          1. This barometer is sometimes called a &lsquo;regulator&rsquo;. We will use it in these instructions. The meter on the right measures the pressure in the oxygen cylinder - its maximum measurement is 28,000 kiloPascals (kPa), equivalent to 280 bars. While the meter on the left measures the cooking gas cylinder - its maximum measurement is 1400 kPa, equivalent to 14 bars.<br />
          2. This tire barometer can measure up to 11 bars. We will use it in our procedure.<br />
          3. The meter on the right measures a maximum of 25 atmospheres - almost equivalent to 25 bars, while the meter on the left measures a maximum of 2.5 atmospheres - almost equivalent to 2.5 bars.<br />
          4. This tire barometer can measure a maximum of 16 bars.

        <h2>CAR BOMB PREPARATION:</h2>
        <p><span class="red italic underline redhead">1 - Mixing the gases:</span><br><br>
          Discharge gas from the cooking gas cylinder until only 3 bars are left in it.<br />
          &bull; Note: to be sure of the required amount, you have to measure the pressure after every few moment of releasing the gas. Use a barometer suitable for the cooking gas cylinder.<br />
          &bull; Note: If you do not have the suitable barometer, there is a simple way to measure the pressure by a tire barometer ( g 1.1).<br />
          &bull; Take a normal cooking gas regulator and cut its connecting nut off. Use a hacksaw to cut at the yellow mark ( g 1.2).<br />
          &bull; Take a tire&rsquo;s inner tube and cut the valve stem off, in such its lower part ts the nut ( g 1.3).<br />
          &bull; Fit the valve stem into the nut precisely.<br />
          &bull; Apply epoxy from the outside to provide a strong adhesion between the valve stem and the nut and prevent the gas from leaking. Also apply a little of epoxy inside&mdash;do not block the hole. Now the nut is ready to use with the tire barometer and the cooking gas cylinder ( g 1.4).

          <span id="bigone">Hint</span>
          <p>
            - You can use oxygen from medical or welding cylinders.<br><br>
            - You can also use other fuels instead of propane, e.g. hydrogen, methane or acetylene.<br><br>
            - These fuels give better results, if security measures allow you to buy.<br><br>
            - You can collect the gas in one Cooking Gas Cylinder instead of six cylinders, as long as the pressure is not lower than 12 bars. The higher the gas pressure the stronger the explosion.

            If you are planning to hide your identity and cover your trail during the operation, begin from the time you set your feet to purchase the ingredients.<br /><br />
            Wipe your ngerprints.<br /><br />
            Use a car that will not reveal your identity.<br /><br />

          If the connector is unavailable, or buying it may draw attention to you, you can use a normal cooking gas regulator with a bit of modi cation. You will have to drill a hole from the inside to let oxygen gas pass into the cylinder.<br><br>

          <span class="red italic underline">3 - Insert 9 bars of oxygen gas into the cooking gas cylinder.</span>
