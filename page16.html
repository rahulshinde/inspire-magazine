        <p>The western media endeavors to portray the American empire as old favorite, the defender of peace, the number one human rights protector and that it has values and principles that they call to. Is this the feeling of billions of people? <span>Do people really buy this? Or is the reality different?</span>
        <br>
        <br>
        If the American people have been convinced of this, then they are in big trouble. They do not know the hell and wail awaiting them, especially with their great nation breathing its final breath?
        <br>
        <br>
        <span>Do you remember, o American people, how much you ridiculed the Russians when they clapped for Gorbachev in Kremlin, while the Soviet Union was collapsing and falling down?</span> It really was a farce; disgracefully ignoring a situation that no government respecting its people can ignore. 
        <br>
        <br>
        Don’t you see that what you ridiculed in the past is what people ridicule you and your government with today?

        Isn’t it more reasonable for the American government to be frank with its people regarding the true state of affairs? Isn’t it time for it to talk openly to its people on what the near future holds for them? Isn’t it the American people’s right to know what awaits them? And how to face the future?

        What makes this critical is America’s mastery of creating enemies. It has been totally successful in gathering worldwide enmity through its tyranny and imperialistic policies.Do you think the Japanese have forgotten what happened in Hiroshima and Nagasaki? Do you think America’s atrocities in Vietnam and Panama could be forgotten? Even what took place in Germany, do you think Germans have forgotten the degradation subsequent to the second world war? Don’t think Germans have forgotten. <span>The starvation victims will never forget the thousands of tons of wheat you disposed of in the ocean while thousands of children were dying in front of their eyes, the millions of children who died under your arsenal’s besiege and as a result of the radiation from your forbidden weapons.</span> They died in wars their short lives were never part of. It is simply out of question for the nations oppressed by America to forget, it’s a matter of a rumbling blaze under calm ash, buried hate burning in their hearts. A time bomb. They all wait for the right moment to take revenge.

          I augur badly for you. A terrifying dark future awaits you; a moment of revenge, not only from Muslims, but also from many enemies some you may not know and some you may have forgotten, but they will never forget you.

          Nations pass through same stages men pass: birth, childhood, prime of youth, old age and then struggle with death; and there is no sane person doubting that America has reached the latter. Like men, nations’ final days differ. In the end, both men and nations harvest what they sowed.

          Therefore, a nation with the most hideous crime history known to man should not dream of a happy ending on a
