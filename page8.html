          It seems that the drone strikes are hitting in areas where they are killing civilians. And what it’s doing is turning people in Yemen, that might not be disposed having anything against the United States, into potential enemies that have legitimate grudge against America. We saw that repeatedly.

          Rather than winning the hearts and minds of Yemeni civilians, America is alienating them by killing their relatives and friends. [...] Certainly, there may be short-term military gains from killing militant leaders in these strikes, but they are minuscule compared with the long-term damage the drone program is causing. A new generation of leaders is spontaneously emerging in furious retaliation to attacks on their territories and tribes.

          However, the increased reliance on drones undermines our long-term interest in a stable, secure, and sustainable partner in Yemen. A growing body of research indicates that civilian casualties and material damage from drone strikes discredit the central government and engender resentment towards the United States. Where drone strikes have hit civilians, news reports and first-hand accounts increasingly indicate that affected families and villages are demonstrating and chanting against the Yemeni and US government.

            What scares me about drone strikes is how they are perceived around the world. The resentment created by American use of unmanned strikes ... is much greater than the average American appreciates. They are hated on a visceral level, even by people who’ve never seen one or seen the effects of one.”

            Drones will always be an easy way for [organizations like Al-Qāeda] to gain anti-American support. When something like a drone strike comes crashing down in people’s front bedrooms or front rooms, that’s going to help you recruit and radicalize, absolutely.

            Given Yemen’s tribal structure, the U.S. generates roughly forty to sixty new enemies for every AQAP operative killed by drones [...] In war, unmanned aircraft may be a necessary part of a comprehensive military strategy. In a country where we are not at war, however, drones become part of our foreign policy, dominating it altogether, to the detriment of both our security and political goals.
