        <span class="bold italic">Why Did I Choose Al-Qaeda</span> is a weekly column in which we interview brothers around the world, asking them to describe the number one  reason why he chose to join Al-Qaeda. This week, Shaykh Abu Mus’Ab Al-Awlaki offers his reason: 
        <br>
        <span class="uppercase red">because they terrorize the enemies of Allah.</span>

        <p>Among the things Allāh has bestowed  upon Al-Qāeda and other Mujahideen, is that they terrorize the enemies of Allāh. Not all of this Ummah terrorize the enemies of Allāh.
        <br>
        <br>
        He who terrorizes 'the enemies of Allāh' complies with the divine order of I'dād (preparation and training)and Jihād, Allāh says: And prepare against them your strength to the utmost of your power, including steeds of war, to strike terror into (the hearts of )the enemies of Allāh and your enemies, and others besides whom you may not know but whom Allāh knows. Whatever you shall spend in the cause of Allāh shall be repaid unto you and you shall not be treated unjustly [8: 60]
        <br>
        <br>
        He who does not comply with this divine order, I'dād and Jihād, has no share in the terrorizing of the enemies of Allāh.
        <br>
        <br>
        Inflicting terror on the enemies of Allāh moves you closer to Him. Ibn Katheer - may Allāh have mercy on him - said: "His word 'turhibūna' to strike terror on the enemies of Allāh and your enemies'  i.e. among the kuffār." Tafsīr Ibn Kathīr.
        <br>
        <br>
        Indeed, whoever abandons I'dād, Jihād and the consolidation of the ' Aqeedah of Al-Walā Wal Barā (alliance and disavowal) and calls for counter-terrorism conferences and negotiation with the Jews, Christians and others, is among the people of the alleged moderation as per the hypcrites' dictionary. And as for he who follows the Orders of Allāh to his capability by terrorizing the enemy is a terrorist, a militant extremist and a radical. We say: Terrorism has been prescribed against the enemies of Allāh by the text of the aforementioned verse.

        <p>Congratulations to you, O Mujahideen, for the terror you have inflicted on the enemies of Allāh! How many plans have you made them refrain from executing? And if Allāh did not use you, the crimes of the Americans and their supporters would have increased, so would have their violation of the honor of  Muslims and their money. Your terror is a pious act drawing you closer to Allāh. How could we not like those who terrorize the enemies of Allāh?
        <br>
        <br>
        How could we not pursue the path of those who make them (kuffār) panic and terrorize them as they terrorize Muslims?
        <br>

        Listen to the Amir of the ‘Islamic State of Iraq', Sheikh Abū'Omar Al-Qurashi Al-Baghdādi–may Allāh accept him, as he addressed his soldiers, a speech which terrorizes the enemies of Allāh. 
        <br>
        <br>
        He said:
        <br>
        <span>“Erupt the volcano of anger. Burn the ground under the feet of the Jews and their supporters, wipe out their armies, destroy their vehicles, shoot down their planes, and prepare for them each and every ambush, ambush them in their homes, valleys and corners. Make your nights a cover (for you), change their days to fire. Grill their flesh by car bombs, cut off their limbs by mines and take off their hearts by inflicting panic with snipers."</span>
        <br>
        <br>
        How much we would love to hear these speeches from hundreds and thousands of this Ummah's leaders? Don't you know that because of our abandoning of Jihād we live in humiliation and shame. 
        <br>
        <br>
        Know that Al-Qāeda’s terrorism is  against all who show enmity towards  Islam. It is not essential for the enemy of Islam to have blue eyes or yellow skin! Al-Qāeda is terrorizing the enemies of Allāh; the Jews, the Christians, the apostates and others. Anyone who follows the media and is aware of their movements knows how Allāh has fill their hearts with the fear of Al-Qāeda, which is fighting the enemies of Allāh, whether he is a Western infidel or an Arab apostate. </p>

          Sheikh Abū Mus‘ab al-Zarqāwi - may Allāh accept him - said:
          <br>
          <br>
          <span>“The time has passed for the Ummah to accept to suckle humiliation and shame. The time has passed for its promising dawn to be occupied by the hands of the hypocrites of our compatriots. In the last century, the nation sacrificed the precious and expensive, and fought and waged Jihād against the infidel occupier. With our Ummah in a deep heedlessness, unenviable naivety, it allowed the opportunistic munāfiqīn to take over the helm of power, and hold leadership positions. They did to the people of Islam what the foreign infidel was unable to do a hundredth of. This bitter experience is still present in our minds. It is still clear before our eyes. And we will not allow it to happen again, biidhnillāh. Your righteous sons have revived- bihamdillāh- the jurisprudence of our righteous predecessors of fighting the sects of apostasy, and the application of the Rule of Allāh on the apostates and the mumtani‘īn (abstainers) from the Laws of Allāh. Our Jihād will continue, without differentiating between the Western infidel and the Arab apostate until Khilāfah resurfaces on Earth, or we die for that purpose.”</span>

          Do you like to hear these words directed to the enemies; Americans and the apostates? Or do you like to hear the words of those who say that these tawāghīt rulers are not kuffār, but wulātu umūrinā (the governors of our issues)!! Which of these two terrorizes the enemies of Allāh? It should be noted, that the conferences called ‘counter-terrorism conferences,’ which are attended by some scholars, are not allowed to attend to, even if the intention of some of the scholars may be good.Because if a Muslim and a kāfir agree on a word, while the Muslim has good intention and the kāfir has a bad intention, their agreement should not be regarded. The word should be changed to another which has no gateway for them. This is indicated by the fact that Allāh has forbidden the believers to say, ‘ra‘inā‘, so as not to agree with the Jews. The Jews used this word to mean ‘ra’ūnah‘ (negative meaning). Allāh the Almighty says: 
          <br>
          <br>
          O you who believe! 
          <br>
          <br>
          Say not (to the Messenger of Allāh) ‘rā’ina’ but say ‘ūnđurnā’ (make us understand) and for the disbelievers there is a painful torment [2: 104]
          <br>
          <br>
          The term ‘terrorism’ is meant by Americans and the Munafiqīn to be Jihād, while some scholars intend another meaning, but they agreed on the word. Basing on that, it is not permissible to attend the so-called ‘counter-terrorism conferences’.  You should know: This term, which was brought by the Americans and their agents to attack Islam, did not come out of the blue. It came after they felt their hearts have been really terrified by the Mujahideen, they shouted out of fear of the sons of Islam through their own media. Congratulations to you, O Mujahideen! This is a great ‘Ibādah! Being among a people who terrorizes the enemies of Allāh is dearer to me than being among a people who do not.
