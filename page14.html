            <span class="semibold">Smokey: How is it that the world’s only remaining superpower, the nation that defeated the Third Reich and the Soviet Union, is quaking in its boots before a few dozen arabs?
            <br><br>
            GymRat: The thing that gets me is why does Obama still carry qudos, its apparent for all that he is even worst than bush, and yet celebrities flock to him, even the desperate Malala wanted a piece of the obama
            <br><br>
            Bilderberg CEO: Richard Nixon? He got busted spying on his competitors, and he resigned. Obama has the NSA spying on the ENTIRE COUNTRY and he is still in office.
            <br><br>
            John McCain: If we don’t change our stupid foreign policies, there will sooner or later be many more people overseas wishing to do this country harm! We’re already the most hated country in the world and through our own stupidity that will only get worse. Moreover, we’re spending ourselves into oblivion over this!
            <br>
            JBlargle Zog: Seriously, we need to stop invading foreign soil. I know it’s in our nature but we have better options.
            <br><br>
            Terry Lynn Sullivan: This day and age, it’s hard to respect the ignorance and blind faith, together with the blind “allegiance” of any American citizen that believes USA’s wars and occupations somehow “serve our nation”.
            <br><br>
            Sawyer White: You call them terrorists yet AMERICA is the country who is attacking and bombing other nations. WAKE UP! I have seen the enemy and we are them!
            <br><br>
            Jackross: Because the Pentagon, and the US government are addicted to killing. A drone strike that vaporises a dozen innocent bystanders is like a first cup of Joe in the morning. The nutters couldn’t get through the rest of the day without one
            <br><br>
            Billy Nelson: You people who think it’s all good to go to the Middle East and kill innocent people are morons. THAT IS WHY 9/11 HAPPENED IN THE FIRST PLACE!
            <br><br>
            McBride: Civilians enjoy fireworks. It’s a part of the Fourth of July. But vets who served in war zones and [have] gone through mortar and bomb attacks, those sounds trigger to the body that they’re under threat.
            <br><br>
            Lisa (vat’s widow): It’s not just families like mine that know sacrifice so intimately. We don’t get a do-over, we don’t get our husbands home, we can’t regrow them. We just have to figure out how to move forward in a positive way.
            <br><br>
            Midgick: Our Country really needs to concentrate on America and not all these other Countries. We have millions of poor and hungry people right here in the good ol USA. Take care of your own, then maybe you can address the World’s problems. Want to solve our $$$ problems then concentrate on us, not them.</span>
