            <span class="bold">Do not be sad</span> when you do not hear from many of the scholars in the Muslim world and elsewhere a word of support or guidance, because they do not hear your news except from the media. It is their source of information and based on it they give their opinions that you know of.
            <br><br>
            <span class="bold">Do not be sad</span>, O you who have established the sharīah of Allāh when you see those who label themselves <a href="https://twitter.com/billmaher?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor" target="_blank">falsely as scholars</a> betray you and try to divide your ranks. Because you have achieved in years what they thought was inconceivable and based on this false view they have established for themselves programs and wrong assumptions which have misguided many of the creation of Allāh. Some of them think that establishing the rule of Allāh cannot be achieved except through the ballot box which is approved by the UN. In their eyes, Islāmic rule and democracy are equal. Some of them believe we are in the Makkan stage and have therefore set for themselves programs that are limited according to the rules of Makkah. Others have joined you only to fall at the first test and then turned against you and betrayed you. Others stood against you for no reason but for envy and greed.
            <br><br>
            <span class="bold">Do not be sad</span>, O you who have written with the blood of some of your best men an honorable legacy when you see the double faced Sheikh Sharīf receiving unlimited support because America is pleased with him, and when America is pleased with someone the rest of the governments of the world would be pleased with him, and if the governments are pleased with him then a great number of scholars would also be pleased with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOkXQuhGKiM" target="_blank">him</a>, even though he only controls less than four square kilometers.
            However, you, who control most of the country and rule it according to the sharīah of Allāh ﷻ do not receive a fraction of the support which Sharīf receives because America and the International community are not happy with you. They are not happy with you because, among other things, you have stopped the work of missionary relief agencies and recently because you banned music from radio stations, which according to those scholars it is okay to listen to if you didn’t play it yourself.
            <br><br>
            <span class="bold">Be pleased</span>, O brothers because you have pleased the Creator by displeasing the creation, because your youth were firm when many others stumbled, because you have nurtured your path with the purest of blood, and because you fulfill the qualities of the victorious group whom are not harmed by those who betray them
            Be pleased because all of the sincere Muslims are with you, joining you in your moments of pleasure and your moments of difficulty and they wish they could carry you on their shoulders and say to the people: These are my forbearers so bring me like them O imposter, when we come together in gatherings
            <br><br>
            <span class="bold">Be pleased</span> because the disbelievers and apostates despise you and wish that they could sleep one night only to hear the news in the morning that you have been destroyed.
            <br><br>
            <span class="bold">Be pleased</span> and show this pleasure and have the masses join in this great celebration because you have become a principle bridge towards the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trademark_symbol" target="_blank">establishment of the Khilāfah</a> on the way of the Prophet and you are a battalion in the army that would liberate the Aqsa Mosque.
