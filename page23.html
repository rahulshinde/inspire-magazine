        <h3>Choosing the place and time is a crucial factor to success in any operation.
          Choose targets in your own country. You know the enemy better, you are
          within. We will point out some general and specific targets as an example.</h3>

        <p>America is our first target, followed by United Kingdom, France and other crusader countries.<br><br>
          As for the field target for the car-bomb, you have places flooded with individuals, e.g. sports events in which tens of thousands attend, election campaigns, festivals and other gathering. The important thing is that you target people and not buildings.

          <h3>Hint:</h3>
          <p>This type of car bomb is used to kill individuals and NOT to destroy buildings. Therefore, look for a dense crowd.</p>
          <h3>Think outside the box:</h3>
          <img src="img/fielddata/hitcrowd.png"/>
          <p>   Be creative in your Jihad. This is ‘Open Source Jihad’. Surprise the enemy, don’t follow a particular protocol. Believe me, there is no SOP for the kind of car you are riding.</p>

          <h1>Remember</h1>
          <p><span id="getfat">Disguise yourself during the operation, appear fat (add some clothes on you), change your complexion, be a ‘clone’, use any mask (believe me embarrassment is the last thing you will think about), wear a mask suitable for the festival, white beards on 25th Dec. All in all, be creative brother. The most important part to hide is your eyes and around. </span></p>

          <p><span id="getsmaller">France’s enmity towards Islam is no secret. It does not even use pretexts to invade Muslims. What happens in Central African Republic is enough evidence. It invaded the country to help the Christian militia fight the regime Army for its relation to Islam</span></p>
